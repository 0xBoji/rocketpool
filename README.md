Rocket Pool is the base layer protocol for decentralised and trustless ETH staking, both liquid using rETH and node operator staking.

Designed to support stakers of all shapes and sizes, Rocket Pool was built with the intent to allow anyone to trustlessly stake ETH to a network of decentralised node operators with full autonomy using protocol based incentives to make sure all parties work in each others best interests.

The core premise behind a protocol is to ensure the network is not beholden to any one party. This is a principle directly linked to Ethereum itself, and a mindset used at every stage of the process as Rocket Pool was developed.

Rocket Pool strives to bring staking to the masses and embody the core ethos of Ethereum, DeFi, specifically the non-custodial, trustless nature that allows self-sovereignty to truly thrive in a decentralised ecosystem.

This is why creating the decentralised staking protocol layer for ETH is so important, especially with the vast majority of players either not having the technical skills to run a node, or the financial capacity to own 32 ETH.

# Test Rocket Pool

To see Rocket Pool in action, clone the repo and run Ganache with the latest version of truffle installed. A quick and easy way to do this is to use the test script provided with the project:
```bash
$ npm install && npm test
```
This will start a local development node (if not already started) and put Rocket Pool through its paces. * These tests are extensive and can take up to 2-10 mins to run depending on your machines specs *.
